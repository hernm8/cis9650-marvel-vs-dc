## 🎯 Project Overview
This project compares the **box-office performance of Marvel and DC movies** from 1950 – 2025.  
Our goal is to explore which brand performs better and whether one franchise shows more consistency over time.

We used the **OMDb API** to pull official movie data (titles, release years, and box-office earnings), cleaned the results in Python, and ran descriptive analysis with basic visualizations.
